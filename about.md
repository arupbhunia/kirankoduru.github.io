I am a recent graduate from NYU School of Engineering. I work with a Startup in Brooklyn, NY. I am a fan of [/r/python](http://reddit.com/r/python) and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/). During the weekends I like to drinking IPAs or participate in hackathons that do good for the community.  

I have been a full stack developer for a long time and have experience creating websites for small businesses. Since then, I have moved on to exploring data in the energy industry. I crawl the web for energy regulatory information and lead a team of enthusiatic software developers at NYU's startup incubator.

### Side projects
While I am not working, I like my side projects. These are some of the interesting projects I worked on


#### Arachne
It is a web UI for scrapy spiders that are created programmatically. I know the scrapy daemon is an option but I wasn't satisfied with the UI that it had. So, voila my new creation.

#### Stayin' Inline
