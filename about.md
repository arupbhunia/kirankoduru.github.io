I am a recent graduate from NYU School of Engineering. I work with a Startup in Brooklyn, NY. I am a fan of [/r/python](http://reddit.com/r/python) and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/). During the weekends I like to drinking IPAs or participate in hackathons that do good for the community.  

_6th Feb - 10th May 2015_ : I am taking python classes at NYU's incubator [Urban Future Lab](http://urbanfuturelab.com/) every Tuesday. So, come join us for food, beer and python programming.
