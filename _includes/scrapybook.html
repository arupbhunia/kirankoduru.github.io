        <h2>I am writing a book!</h2>
        <p>While I do appreciate you reading my blog posts, I would like to draw your attention to another project of mine. I have slowly begun to write a book on how to build web scrapers with python. I go over topics on how to start with scrapy and end with building large scale automated scraping systems. </p>

        <p>If you are looking to build web scrapers at scale then you should signup for the book on <a href="https://leanpub.com/webcrawling-with-scrapy">leanpub</a> now.</p>
